# MyReads Project

INSTALLATION:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS:
* start the server with `npm start`

App Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

1. Currently Reading
2. Want to Read
3. Read

* Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.
* The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
* When you navigate back to the main page from the search page, you should instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page in your library.
